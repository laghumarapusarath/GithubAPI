# GithubAPI

The code is in python and the file is a .ipynb file, so this file should be run in Jupyter notebook. Installing softwares like Anaconda or pycharm should allow you to run the code.

I am using requests module in the code. If this module is not already installed, below code should be run in the terminal to install the module. 

pip install requests
